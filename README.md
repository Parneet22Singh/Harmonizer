An audio harmonizer that not only converts the real-time recorded audio to desired language from a plethora of language choices, but also generates a new audio, with user specified tone (informal, formal, neutral) and syntax of the intial audio, with suitable accent. 

It uses ElevenLabs API for audio modification and generation.
Gemini API handles the conversion of the transcript of the recorder audio, then its conversion to desired tone choice and language.
